1. This package is meant for simulating (Molecular dynamics, Monte Carlo)  any polymer, protein systems.

2. This is written on python with LAMMPS [1] running in background.

3. Use a python version 3.10 or greater. And the latest version for LAMMPS.

4. The core structure is object oriented with every polymer, atom, molecule, simulation have been treated as objects.

5. Some run scripts have been added which was used in the following article- [2]
